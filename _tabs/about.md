I’m Ammar Louah, a Master’s student in Advanced Machine Learning and Multimedia Intelligence. My passion lies in **machine learning, deep learning, and optimization**, with a strong focus on understanding the fundamentals and building systems from scratch.  

### **AI, Computer Vision, and Optimization**  
In **computer vision**, I worked on **image processing** using **MATLAB**, applying advanced filtering and segmentation techniques to analyze and enhance visual data.  

In **optimization and metaheuristics**, I explored **genetic algorithms and integer programming**, solving **constraint-based scheduling problems**. These approaches were crucial in tackling complex, real-world optimization challenges.  

### **Software Development & System Architecture**  
I design and build **full-stack applications** from the ground up, ensuring a structured and scalable approach.  

- **Frontend:** Developed responsive interfaces using **Bootstrap**  
- **Backend:** Built secure and efficient APIs with **Laravel, Node.js, and Express.js**    

### **Big Data & Business Intelligence**  
I expanded into **big data processing** with **Hadoop and Spark**, working with large-scale datasets to extract meaningful insights. \
In **business intelligence**, I leveraged **Power BI** for **data visualization, reporting, and governance**, enabling data-driven decision-making.  

### **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking**  
I have a growing interest in **offensive security and system hardening**, learning through **TryHackMe and HackTheBox**, where I actively explore **penetration testing and exploit development**.  

### **Beyond Tech**  
Outside of my technical work, I enjoy **football and traveling**, always looking for new experiences and challenges.
